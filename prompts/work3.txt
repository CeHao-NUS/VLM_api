[Work 3 Start]

- According to the [key steps] in Work 2, find the corresponding [key point] to in the images. 
- The [key point] should mark the key position where the robot can successfully grasp the object and satisfy the conditions in the [task description].
- What is the representation of this [key point]? Why you choose to grasp here?
- How can this [key point] satisify the [task description]?
- Mark the point in the [multi-view images] and write the position (x,y,z).
- Write "==== Work 3 ====" at the start of the answer.

- Finally, summarize the answer to a template:

```
{
    "Front view": [x, z], 
    "Top view": [x, y], 
    ...
    "Overall pose in 3D": [x, y, z]
}
```
- The "Overall pose in 3D" means you synthesize the results in all views.
