[Work 1 Start]

- Read the images and understand the scene, and objects in them.
- Please build a coordinate in the [multi-view images].
- In the front view, the bottom left is 0, and the upper right is 1. 
- The x-axis points to the right, the z-axis points up, and the y-axis points inside. 

- The coordinate from the other view will change according to the front view.
- For example, in the top view, according to the right-hand rule, x-axis points to right, y-axis points up, and z-axis points outside.
- You should consider this condition when building the coordinate.

- Finally, summarize your answer including:
 1. From what view is these [multi-view images]?
 2. Where is the origin of (0,0) and (1,1)? 
 3. What are the direction of (x,y,z)?
 4. In one image, what do points to right, and points to up represent?
 5. What is the bounding box (4 corner points) of the target object in each view?

- Write "==== Work 1 ====" at the start of the answer.
