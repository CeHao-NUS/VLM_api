==== Work 1 ====

1. From what view are these [multi-view images]?
   - The first image is from the front view.
   - The second image is from the top view.

2. Where is the origin of (0,0) and (1,1)?
   - In the front view, the origin (0,0) is at the bottom left corner, and (1,1) is at the upper right corner.
   - In the top view, the origin (0,0) is at the bottom left corner, and (1,1) is at the upper right corner.

3. What are the directions of (x,y,z)?
   - In the front view:
     - x-axis points to the right.
     - y-axis points inside (into the table).
     - z-axis points up.
   - In the top view:
     - x-axis points to the right.
     - y-axis points up.
     - z-axis points outside (out of the table).

4. In one image, what do points to right, and points to up represent?
   - In the front view:
     - Points to the right represent the x-axis.
     - Points to up represent the z-axis.
   - In the top view:
     - Points to the right represent the x-axis.
     - Points to up represent the y-axis.

5. What is the bounding box (4 corner points) of the target object in each view?
   - In the front view:
     - Bottom left corner: (0.4, 0.3)
     - Bottom right corner: (0.6, 0.3)
     - Top left corner: (0.4, 0.6)
     - Top right corner: (0.6, 0.6)
   - In the top view:
     - Bottom left corner: (0.4, 0.4)
     - Bottom right corner: (0.6, 0.4)
     - Top left corner: (0.4, 0.6)
     - Top right corner: (0.6, 0.6)

Note: The bounding box coordinates are approximate and based on visual estimation from the images provided.

**Key Steps to Finish the Task:**

1. **Identify the Target Object:**
   - The target object is the purple mug located near the center of the table.

2. **Position the Robot:**
   - Move the robot arm to a position above the mug, ensuring it is aligned with the mug's handle for a secure grasp.

3. **Adjust the Gripper:**
   - Open the gripper to a width slightly larger than the mug's handle.

4. **Lower the Gripper:**
   - Slowly lower the gripper towards the mug's handle, ensuring it is centered and aligned.

5. **Grasp the Mug:**
   - Close the gripper around the mug's handle, applying enough force to securely hold the mug without causing damage.

6. **Lift the Mug:**
   - Carefully lift the mug off the table, ensuring it is held steadily and does not tilt or spill.

7. **Move to the Desired Location:**
   - Transport the mug to the designated location as per the task requirements.

8. **Release the Mug:**
   - Gently open the gripper to release the mug at the desired location.

**Grasping Point:**
- The robot should grasp the mug by its handle. This provides a secure grip and minimizes the risk of the mug slipping or tilting during the lifting and moving process.

By following these steps, the robot can successfully pick up the mug from the table and complete the task as described.
==== Work 3 ====

**Key Point Representation:**
- The key point is the position on the mug's handle where the robot can securely grasp it. This point is chosen because the handle provides a secure grip and minimizes the risk of the mug slipping or tilting during the lifting and moving process.

**Why Choose to Grasp Here:**
- Grasping the mug by its handle ensures a stable and secure hold, allowing the robot to lift and transport the mug without spilling its contents or dropping it.

**How This Key Point Satisfies the Task Description:**
- By grasping the mug at the handle, the robot can effectively pick up the mug from the table and move it to the desired location, fulfilling the task requirements.

**Marked Key Point in Multi-View Images:**

- **Front View:**
  - Position: (0.55, 0.45)
  - The key point is marked on the handle of the mug.

- **Top View:**
  - Position: (0.55, 0.55)
  - The key point is marked on the handle of the mug.

**Overall Pose in 3D:**
- Synthesizing the results from both views, the overall pose in 3D is:
  - Position: (0.55, 0.55, 0.45)

**Summary:**
```
{
    "Front view": [0.55, 0.45], 
    "Top view": [0.55, 0.55], 
    "Overall pose in 3D": [0.55, 0.55, 0.45]
}
```

By marking this key point, the robot can successfully grasp the mug by its handle and complete the task as described.
